# odin-recipes2.0
My first project from The Odin Project (I'm calling it 2.0 because this is my second time going through this part of TOP's Foundations).
This project refreshed my memory of basic HTML; using images, links, and text. 
I used the terminal built into VS Code to create the project directories, delete files, and move files. I used Git to continually update the files, commit changes, and push the project to Github.
