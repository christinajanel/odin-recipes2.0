        <h1>Traditional Irish Stew</h1>
        <img src="../images/irish-stew.webp" height="563" width="750" alt="stew with lamb meat, potatoes, carrots">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Irish stew is more commonly made with lamb in Ireland. It's easy to prep and then let it cook slowly until the meat and vegetables are fall-apart tender and the broth is full of flavor. Every Irish household has its own recipe for this comforting dish and this is my mom's. It's perfect on a cold day or on St. Patrick's Day served with a pint of Guinness, of course!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 pounds boneless lamb shoulder, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
            <li>2 carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
            <li>1 parsnip, peeled and cut into large chunks (Optional)</li>
            <li>4 cups water, or as needed</li>
            <li>3 large potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup coarsely chopped leeks</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add lamb pieces and cook, stirring gently, until evenly browned. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir in onion and cook for a few minutes. Stir in water and add carrots and parsnips (if using). Cover and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer until lamb is tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Stir in potatoes, and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, before adding leeks and rosemary. Continue to simmer uncovered, until potatoes are tender but still whole.</li>
            <li>Serve piping hot in bowls garnished with fresh parsley. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
        <p>If you use a tougher cut of meat, you can leave it to simmer longer before adding the potatoes.</p>
        <p>Parsnips and fresh rosemary are not traditional ingredients in Irish stew but my mom added them for a touch of sweetness and delicious flavor. You can add the parsnips with the potatoes if you prefer.</p>
