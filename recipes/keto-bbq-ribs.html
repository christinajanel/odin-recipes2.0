        <li>Place one layer aluminum foil on a baking sheet, leaving about a 2-inch overhang on all sides.</li>
        <li>Pat ribs dry using a paper towel; rub spice mixture into both sides rib racks. Place racks, meaty-sides up, on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with one layer aluminum foil; tightly crimp the edges. Refrigerate 8 to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Place rack in center of oven.</li>

        <li>Drain wood chips. Place in an aluminum foil packet; poke several holes in packet. Place packet on the hottest part of the grill; close the lid. When chips are smoking, oil the grate where rib racks will be placed.</li>
        <li>Remove ribs from foil; place racks on the oiled grate. Brush with 1/2 cup barbecue sauce. Close the lid; grill for 5 to 10 minutes, monitoring closely for flare-ups.
